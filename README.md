# sf_citations_eda
 An exploration of San Francisco parking citations and its general trends.
 
## What is this EDA about?
 This EDA looks into the general trends regarding parking citations, specifically in San Francisco. This specifically includes looking at citation-level, street-level, and time-level trends in order to find out common trends about citations in SF.
 
 Personally, I wanted to answer three questions that I believed would give the most insight about parking citations in SF:
  - What are the most common types of citations?
  - Where do these citations occur?
  - When do these citations occur?
 
 ## Who is this EDA for?
  This EDA is for anyone who would like to learn more about the general trends that exist about parking citations and for those who would like to save money by getting less citations.
